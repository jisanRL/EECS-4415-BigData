    LET is an XQuery clause.  It allows one to assign a variable
    a node, node-list, or value.  Here, we assign it a string
    (a URI).  We access a remote source as in a previous example,
    but with easier, nicer syntax.  (Not having to declare a
    variable.)  But to do this with LET, we have to do it as
    part of a properly formed XQuery (e.g., with FOR).
