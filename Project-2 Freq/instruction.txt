The mapper -> LetterMap.py and WordMap.py 
and reducers -> LetterReduce.py and WordReduce.py work fine

My Docker was collapsing constantly and was not getting the output. 
I belive an issue with the docker dektop version 
and the python version im using in my pc and the one in the docker image are not compitable with each other 
which my have caused the problem
